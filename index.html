            <p>While I do love playing a game of rugby league or having a wrestle with my friends, I also thoroughly enjoy e-sports and most types of video games. I have been glued to the computer since a young age and when I wasn’t outside running around and socialising with friends, I was playing games on the computer. These include (but aren’t limited to): World of Warcraft, League of Legends, the Fallout series, Team Fortress 2, Garry’s Mod, Half Life series, Mordhau and Counter Strike. As of the time of this writing, I am pre-loading Cyberpunk 2077 which is a CD Projekt Red game which has been in production for over 8 years. Very keen to play this one!</p>

<!--INTEREST IN IT-->

<div class="title">
  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
</div>
<div class="chunks">
  <p>My interest in IT started at a young age, around 6 years old. One of my earliest memories is sitting on my Dad’s shoulders watching him while he played videogames. Shortly after my brother and I begged him to buy us our own computer and we would (try to) share equal use of it while we were at home. I have been glued to the computer monitor ever since and spend most of my waking hours in front of a screen. Around the house I help my mum with anything tech related, and Dad always has some interesting facts within the world of technological innovations. He also likes to stay updated with the latest hardware/phones, so I believe I can attribute my love for IT to him. I have no technical skillset or experience in the field of Information Technology and that’s why I’m enrolling in this course. My typing speed, however, is above 100wpm on average which I’m quite proud of.</p>
<p>I chose to enrol in this course with RMIT as I started looking for university courses late in the year of 2020. Many of the local on-campus universities around me had already closed off applications and I didn’t want to wait until next year to start. I applied with Open Universities Australia and they placed me into the ‘Intro to Information Technology’ course which I’ll use to either complete a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT or continue my studies within a local university. The freedom and accessibility of online study with RMIT is a great way to acclimatise to ‘uni life’.</p>
<p>During my studies, I expect to learn a large, broad scope of all things IT related. This includes hardware, software, networking, coding, technical support, data, security, and web design. I’m aware that the course we are undertaking is only an ‘introduction’ but believe it will lay a great foundation to build up the rest of my IT skills upon. Even during the first week alone, I went from having no knowledge in HTML & CSS to building my first website and making it look respectable. It was a great learning experience and proved to me that if I focus and stay motivated, even hard tasks and subjects are doable to a high standard.</p>

</div>
<div class="chunks">
  <p>Being an ICT support technician revolves around the maintenance and instalment of computer systems and technology. They are also used to troubleshoot and solve technical issues which can be hardware or software related. This job is appealing to me as I would be able to help both ordinary people and larger businesses when they are facing technical problems that they cannot solve by themselves.</p>
<p>ICT support technicians must have a wide range of skills and experience in many aspects of Information Technology.  Some of these skills may include hardware/software instalment and troubleshooting, programming, networking, and monitoring/maintenance of computer systems. A good ICT support technician can work well in groups, communicate effectively, and have great customer service.</p>
<p>Currently I have no formal qualifications or skills needed for the role of ICT support technician. My understanding of IT is overly broad with only a few weeks of learning specific areas within the subject.</p>
<p>To gain the skills needed for the role, I will first need to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology. By attaining this degree I will be qualified to work in a low level Help Desk/IT support environment which I can utilise to hone and develop my skillset. Completing other courses such as ‘Windows Server 2016 Certification’ and the “CompTIA A+” program I can use them as qualifications to show my experience and knowledge to the employer for an ICT support technician role.</p>

</div>
<div class="chunks">
  <p>The results from these three tests offer insight into my actions, thoughts, and behaviours which I had never took notice of. Previously, I had always considered myself ‘introverted’ and a person who likes to think things through before acting on them. However, upon reflection, I believe I am an extroverted person as I flourish while working and communicating with others, and I take pleasure in participating in social events. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator suggests that my decisions are made mainly on gut feeling and intuition rather than logic and careful thought. This gives me a valuable perspective on future decisions as I will likely take a longer pause to think and deliberate, as opposed to trusting my heart straight away.  My results as an “activist” for the Mumford and Honey LSQ also confirm that a ‘hands-on’ and ‘open-minded’ style of learning is crucial for me to learn effectively and efficiently. Scoring 83% on the Big Five Personality Test for “agreeableness” also highlights my ability to understand and empathise with people regardless of their issue. Even though I may have not been through the same experience, it is necessary to remain optimistic and actively listen to the individual.</p>

<p>These results can influence my behaviour in a team in both positive and negative aspects. For example, the tests results indicate that my work is usually done sporadically and without planning, which may not be the most suitable for group work. To combat this, I can allocate time each week and focus purely on the group work that needs to be completed. On the other hand, my results show that I am ‘open-minded’ and willing to dive headfirst into new experiences, which I believe will impact my group’s experience positively. Brainstorming and group discussions are a big part of teamwork, and I feel that my personality allows me to actively employ these group-based activities and use them to communicate our thoughts, feelings, and relate to each other on a personal level.</p>

<p>When forming a team for group work, it will be important to get a mix of personalities and learning styles together. By doing this, we can focus on the key strengths of everyone while also helping each other with our weaknesses. Some team members might be technically gifted but lacking motivation and drive to get the best marks possible. This can be countered by having all members of the team communicate their goals and aims for the project. If a member is unable to sort out their own work schedule, they might be able to reach out to someone else and ask for help. Without a diverse mix of personalities and learning styles, it will be hard to balance all the aspects of team-based work effectively. </p>

<!--PROJECT IDEA-->

<div class="title">
  <h2>Project idea</h2>
</div>
<div class="chunks">
<h3>Tech-aid.com.au</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>“Tech-aid.com.au” is a website aiming to provide solutions for novice and average computer users who are experiencing technical issues. The website contains key features for technical assistance and troubleshooting such as: an FAQ, a list of common issues, guides for software/hardware instalment and updates, live chat, demonstration videos, and remote access. Tech-aid provides clear instructions and uses language that is comprehensible by users without technical experience. The goal of Tech-aid is to provide easily accessible information and help to individuals who are not able to solve their own problems.</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>This project will be useful for users of all ages, abilities, and knowledge regarding computer issues. Older adults, for example, often feel outpaced by the vast amount of information and learning that coincides with the increase in the use of technology. When they encounter a problem, they might not know where to turn for help, or even realise that they need assistance in the first place. Tech-aid will offer troubleshooting and other forms of help in an easily digestible method, attempting to not only fix the issue at hand but also teach the user about basic computer functions and utilisations.</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Tech-aid will run online as a HTML and CSS based website. Tech-aid will also have elements of JavaScript to utilise Live Chat. The website will feature large, clickable hyperlinks as headings that will redirect the user to the correct page or section. The hyperlink headings will take the user to: an FAQ, a list of common issues, guides for software/hardware instalment and updates, a live chat feature, and remote access setup. There will also be a glossary section in case the user is unsure about what a certain word or term means.</p>
<p>CSS will be utilised to give the UX of the website a dark grey background and making the text a bright white colour. All font size will be slightly larger than the average website, have a line length limit of 80 characters and include a line spacing of 150%. This CSS styling is designed with the visually impaired in mind to provide the most accessible and user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>The FAQ will list general questions as hyperlinks, with a search box near the top of the page where the user can type in keywords to highlight a specific question. Some questions will require a long or in-depth explanation, in which case a separate tab will open with the relevant information, context, examples, and answer. These questions will include “What is hardware?”, “Why does my computer restart without warning?”, “How do I clean my keyboard?”, and “What do I do when I’ve forgotten my password?”, as examples.</p>
<p>A list of common issues will also be available, attempting to troubleshoot and guide the user through their problem. Like the FAQ, there will also be a search feature near the top of the page so the user can search for keywords and quickly find their issue. Common issues that everyday users can face include, “no internet/Wi-Fi connection”, “Windows running slow or freezing”, “process and application crashes or not responding”, and “freeing up hard drive space”. By clicking on any of these links, a separate tab will open with the relevant instructions and context for the issue.</p>
<p>There will be a section of the website devoted to software and hardware instalment/upgrades. By clicking on this section titled “Guides”, the user will be directed to a page with different topics about installing both software and hardware; and upgrading them if they are outdated. Each topic will include relevant videos showing a screen recording or actual video of the IT support individual installing/upgrading the software/hardware. These will be YouTube videos embedded in the topic page, so they are easily viewable by the user. As an example, there will be a video of the IT support individual opening their computer case, removing a hard drive, and replacing it. The steps taken in the video will be written in a step-by-step text format on the Tech-aid Guides page, and will have both audio commentary and Closed Captioning features on the video itself</p>
<p>The live chat feature will be implemented by “Crisp” which is a free multichannel messaging platform. It will allow the user to ask any further questions inside a chat box in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. Crisp will send a notification to the IT support individual as soon as a message is sent, allowing for an instant response or feedback to the user. This feature will be useful as a technical issue or query may not be covered on the website, but still be solvable by the IT support individual.</p>
<p>Remote access may be needed or requested by some users as their technical issues might not be covered on Tech-aid. This gives the IT support individual control over the user’s computer without needing to be located physically at their computer. Remote access can be utilised to gain information about the technical issue, or even allow the IT support individual to fix the problem entirely. This will all be done through TeamViewer and there will be a step-by-step guide located on the “Remote Access” page showing the user how to install and set up the program.</p>
<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<o>Software needed to create and manage the website includes: “Atom” to build the webpage in HTML & CSS, “Crisp” to use the features of live chat, and TeamViewer to handle the remote access and screen capture. The Tech-aid website will be hosted by https://au.godaddy.com/ which provides unlimited websites, bandwidth and 24/7 security monitoring.</p>
<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>
  <ul><li>HTML and CSS proficiency to create an appealing and easily accessible website which users with vision impairments can understand</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting skills</li>
    <li>Communication and patience with users</li>
    <li>Use of special programs/applications such as "Crisp", "TeamViewer", and "Atom".</li>
    <li>Installing and updating software and hardware</li></ul>
<p>All the skills listed above are feasible to attain with practice and focus. Crisp and TeamViewer are both paid software which are designed to be easily understandable by both the user and the IT support individual. Hardware instalment is straight forward and teachable to the novice computer user if they follow the guide made for them. The troubleshooting skills needed may require some trial and error to learn, however, with the amount of information available on the internet most issues that will arise will have an answer or fix already.</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>If the project is successful, valuable support and knowledge will be given to novice or impaired computer users. Their immediate issues will be solved with the help of an IT support individual, and they will gain some technical skills of their own in the event of a future problem. The website has been designed with the novice user in mind to be easily accessible and understandable by individuals of any skill level. Tech-aid will also give the user the confidence to reach out and ask for support once they see how simple it can be to get effective troubleshooting assistance. </p>
